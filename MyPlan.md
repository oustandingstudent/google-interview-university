1. Concurrent initial studying. This is not so precise, still to realise how this will go together. But the main idea is to get the math foundations but also start getting the notions on data structure and algorithms by implementing it slowly and not exhausting the possibilities. This is because I can immediately get benefits from that knowledge in my profession and interviews and it will help a lot to have notions when I get to study the whole stuff.
    - [ ] Geometry - coursera. Maybe only some parts of the course?
    - [ ] Mathematical thinking - coursera
    - [ ] Pre-University Calculus - edx (if necessary, there are pre-calculus courses on coursera that focus on trigonometry)
    - [ ] Single-variable calculus - OCW scholar
    - [ ] Getting the initial grasp on basic algorithms and data structures by using Cracking the code interview, some of the videos recommended by jwasham and anything else needed (I'm sure it's possible to find more content on that level) helps.
1. Discrete Math - OCW course
1. Algorithms and Data Structures - OCW course
1. Follow the list
1. Soft skills texts and videos?
1. OOP-related stuff?


Coding problems in websites like hackerrank are always a good idea, maybe interleaved with the rest.
